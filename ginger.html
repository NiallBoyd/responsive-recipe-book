      <h2 class="tena">Ginger Sparkle Cookies</h2>
      <p class="light-p tera">There’s nothing like the aroma of ginger cookies baking. Well, except, eating them when they are warm and fresh out of the oven.</p>

      <h2 class="push-1-2">Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups + 2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground allspice</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>¼ tsp each ground cloves and nutmeg</li>
        <li>Pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¼ cup molasses</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Coarse decorating or granulated sugar, for rolling</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="push-1-2">Preparation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li class="milli push-1-4 spcail">Whisk together flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, salt, cloves, nutmeg and cayenne pepper; set aside.</li>

        <li class="milli push-1-4 spcail">Beat butter and brown sugar with electric beaters until light and fluffy, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Beat in egg until combined. Stir in molasses and vanilla until blended. Stir in dry ingredients; beat just until blended. Cover and let stand in refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. (This will make them easy to roll and shape.)</li>

        <li class="milli push-1-4 spcail">Preheat oven to 375°F. Using a tablespoon to measure, roll dough into roughly 1” balls. Roll the balls in sugar to coat and place on parchment paper-lined baking sheets, spacing about 2” apart. Press dough with tines of fork in a crisscross pattern to flatten slightly. Top with a pinch more sugar. (If the dough is too soft to work with, pop in freezer for a few minutes to firm up.)</li>
        <li class="milli push-1-4 spcail">   Bake in middle of the oven, one tray at a time, until the cookies are set around the edges but still a little soft in the centre, about 9 to 11 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 1 month. </li>

        <li class="milli push-1-4 spcail">Cool for 5 minutes of baking sheet and then transfer to wire rack to cool entirely. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or as long as they last!</li>
      </ol>
